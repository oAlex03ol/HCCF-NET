# HCCF-NET

- This repository hosts the official website for the HCSH Information Study Group (資訊讀書會) at XinZhuang High School (新莊高中).
- Developed with `React` for building UI, `Vite` for fast bundling, and `TailwindCSS` for efficient, customizable design.
- This is our first self-developed website, so some techniques or implementations may not be fully refined.

:star: Note : 

- If you have any thoughtful and constructive feedback or suggestions, we would greatly appreciate hearing from you to help us improve.

## Installations :

### Initial Setup (For first-time collaborators)
1. Clone the entire repository from GitHub to your local directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oAlex03ol/HCCF-NET.git
```
2. Navigate to the correct project folder: `HCPC-NET`.
```bash
cd HCCF-NET
```
3. Install all dependencies from `package.json` with `npm` ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) tool).
```bash
npm install  # Don't worry, npm will install everything as instructed in the package.json
```
4. Launch the server on your local machine
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Development Setup (For returning collaborators)
:bulb: Tips :
- Always pull before you push to minimize merge conflicts.
- If you encounter conflicts, resolve them locally before pushing.
- Ensure your Git user.name and user.email are set globally so Git can identify you:
```
# You only need to set them once per computer. For example:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
1. Make sure you’re inside the project folder:
```bash
cd HCCF-NET
```
2. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository to avoid conflicts:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
3. Run this command to stage all your current changes:
```bash
git add .
```
4. Save those staged changes with a message describing what you changed:
```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```
5. Upload your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub
```bash
git push origin "branch-name"
```
